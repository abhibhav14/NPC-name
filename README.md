## NPC-name

### Motivation
* Daniel -> Daneel in an Isaac Asimov book.
* Alignment of protien sequences
This kind of a small modification in the name leads to many possibilities for making NPC names from a "seed" name.


### Running

A complete writeup is in the works, here's how to use it:

1. Change a few parameters under the #configuration heading in the name_gen.py file.The seed needs to be specified in the IPA, which one can look up at [http://www.antimoon.com/resources/phonchart2008.pdf](http://www.antimoon.com/resources/phonchart2008.pdf)

2. Run
```python name_gen```
